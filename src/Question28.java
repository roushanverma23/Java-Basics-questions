 * c) a variable to store department
 * d) a variable to store city
 * e) a variable to store basic salary
 * f) a method to calculate the salary of employee
 * a. if the city is metro then the HRA would be 30% else 20%
 * b. if the employee ID contain M then DA would be 120%, if S then DA would be
 *      110%, if A then DA would be 100%, and if C then DA would be 90%
